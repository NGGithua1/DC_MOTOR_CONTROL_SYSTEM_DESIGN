# DC Motor Control System Design with Integrated Safety Feature

## üìå Overview
This project implements a **DC motor control system** on the STM32F4 microcontroller platform.  
It integrates **PWM-based motor speed control**, a **safety shutoff mechanism** triggered by overcurrent detection, and a simple **user interface with button and LED indicators**.

The system is designed with a focus on **embedded safety**, **real-time monitoring**, and **robust firmware structure**.
